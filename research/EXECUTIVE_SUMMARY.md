# Geepers Plugin Marketplace Submission - Executive Summary

**Date:** December 18, 2025
**Research Status:** COMPLETE - READY FOR ACTION

---

## The Opportunity

Geepers is a mature, production-ready 63-agent orchestration system that's **perfect for community plugin marketplaces**. We have identified 3 viable submission targets with no previous submissions.

---

## Quick Facts

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Marketplaces Found** | 4 total (3 with PR process) |
| **Previous Submissions** | 0 (first time) |
| **Time to First PR** | 1-2 hours |
| **Recommended Target** | Puerto (bandofai/puerto) |
| **Success Probability** | Very High (community-friendly) |

---

## Three-Tier Strategy

### TIER 1: Puerto (START HERE) 🎯
**Status:** Ready now
**Effort:** 1-2 hours
**Probability:** Very High

- Community-friendly marketplace
- Only 2 existing plugins (low competition)
- No complex requirements
- Quick approval process (usually within hours)
- Perfect first victory

**Action:** Fork → Create `plugins/geepers/` → Submit PR → Get feedback → Merge

---

### TIER 2: Claude Code Official (LATER)
**Status:** Research phase
**Effort:** High effort / High impact
**Timeline:** After Puerto success

- Official Anthropic repository
- Not a PR process (direct contact)
- Very selective (13 plugins only)
- Requires momentum from Puerto

**Action:** Contact Anthropic via Discord/email after Puerto submission succeeds

---

### TIER 3: Taskmaster Integration (RESEARCH)
**Status:** Future consideration
**Effort:** Medium
**Timeline:** Q1 2026

- Different type of submission (MCP integration)
- Could wrap agents as task management
- Worth exploring after community adoption

**Action:** Research once Puerto is established
