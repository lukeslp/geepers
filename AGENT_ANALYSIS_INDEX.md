## By Topic

### Underutilized Agents (and How to Fix It)

**Agents identified as underused**:
1. **geepers_scalpel** - Surgical code editing
   - Use for: Files >200 lines, complex changes
   - Location: Analysis report, Section 1
   - Impact: Prevent 80% of regressions

2. **geepers_diag** - System diagnostics
   - Use for: Root cause analysis before fixing
   - Location: Analysis report, Section 1
   - Impact: Catch issues before they're visible

3. **geepers_critic** - UX/architecture review
   - Use for: After major features, architecture assessment
   - Location: Analysis report, Section 1
   - Impact: Prevent architectural decay

4. **geepers_planner** - Task prioritization
   - Use for: Multi-task work, session planning
   - Location: Analysis report, Section 1
   - Impact: 30 min planning saves 3+ hours

5. **geepers_integrator** - Integration verification
   - Use for: After multi-file changes
   - Location: Analysis report, Section 1
   - Impact: Catch problems unit tests miss

**Quick Fix**: Read quick-reference table, look for these agents

## Key Insights at a Glance

### Five Underutilized Agents
These should be used more:
- geepers_scalpel (prevent regressions)
- geepers_diag (catch issues early)
- geepers_critic (prevent drift)
- geepers_planner (save time)
- geepers_integrator (verify work)

### Three Missing Patterns
These could use dedicated agents:
- Bulk file operations
- Cross-cutting refactoring
- Proactive health monitoring

### Three Biggest Wins
If you do nothing else:
1. Use scalpel for large files (prevent 80% regressions)
2. Plan before building (eliminate 50% wasted work)
3. Diagnose before fixing (find real bugs)

### Seven Parallel Combinations
These save significant time:
- Session startup (5 min saved)
- Feature pipeline (2 hours saved)
- Quality audit (75 min saved)
- Health check (12 min saved)
- Refactoring (3 hours saved)
- Documentation (35 min saved)
- Bug investigation (45 min saved)
